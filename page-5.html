      <h1>Musical Performance</h1>
      <p>
        The Festival features many facets of traditional and contemporary Japanese music culture. Our performing artists sing and play live music with Japanese instruments including the harp (Koto), flute (Shakuhachi), three-stringed instrument (Shamisen/Sangen), and drum (Taiko). Experience and feel the passion of each of the talented artists as they perform for the audience at the Japantown Peace Plaza Stage and the Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California (JCCCNC/the Center) Stage.

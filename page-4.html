      <h1>Taiko</h1>
      <p>
        The San Francisco Taiko Dojo performs at the festival. These are the massive, thundering drums that have been used in Japanese cultural practices for centuries. Originally they served a religious function, driving away evil spirits or bringing rain, but now taiko has experienced a revival with the renewed interest in Japanese traditions. The San Francisco Taiko Dojo performing for the festival was the first taiko group in North America, and was founded by Grand Master Seiichi Tanaka in 1968.

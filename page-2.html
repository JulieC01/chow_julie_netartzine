      <h1>Food Stalls</h1>
      <p>
        During the festival weekends, there are several food stalls to check out as well! Visitors can taste the best Japanese outdoor festival foods prepared by various organizations from within the local .Japanese community.. Below will introduce a few of the stalls in the 2022 Cherry Blossom Festival.
        Many of the food vendors are also nonprofit groups so this also helps support their cause.

        <h1>Teri Burger</h1>
        <p>
          One of the food booths was Kimochi, Inc., a senior service agency that has operated in Japantown since July 1971. They care for elders in the community through nutrition, recreation and transportation services. At the festival, they sold Kimochi Teri Burger for $8.

For those two weekends, they anticipate around 6,000 burgers for all four days. The lines were very long all day for this burger.

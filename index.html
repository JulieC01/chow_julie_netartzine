          The Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival (NCCBF) is one of Californiaâ€™s most prominent celebrations of Asian traditions. Each year, over 220,000 people attend this dazzling display showcasing the vibrant colors and grace of the Japanese culture, and the rich heritage and diversity of the Japanese American community. 

          All are welcome to join in the festivities as we celebrate the blooming of the cherry blossoms and Japanese and Japanese American culture. The Festival features Japanese cultural performances, traditional arts, live music, the annual Queen Program, and more. This event is free and open to the public, made possible by the generous donations and support from our corporate and community sponsors and Festival supporters.
          
          The NCCBF is one of the largest cherry blossom festivals outside of Japan, second to the festival in Washington, D.C., and held at one of three remaining officially designated Japantowns in the United States. This mid-April Festival takes place over two weekends, symbolizing the arrival of spring and cherry blossoms in the famously fog-shrouded San Francisco.
          
          Since 1968, the Festival serves to cultivate the continued alliance between Japan and the United States using culture as its bridge. Each year, over 220,000 people attend this dazzling display showcasing the vibrant colors and grace of the Japanese culture and the rich heritage and diversity of the Japanese American community.
